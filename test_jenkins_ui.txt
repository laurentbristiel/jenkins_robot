let's check the UI now
We will go through the global configuration and back home

*** Settings ***
Library  Selenium2Library

*** Test Cases ***
navigate to admin configure and back home page
    open browser  http://localhost:8080/
    Set Selenium Speed  1
    # using xpath is not the best way to target link (might become obsolete)
    # but that's the easiest/quickest way I found 
    click element  xpath=//*[@id="tasks"]/div[4]/a[2]
    click element  xpath=//*[@id="management-links"]/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/div[1]/a
    location should be  http://localhost:8080/configure
    page should contain  /Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home
    # go back home
    click image  //*[@id="top-panel"]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/a/img
    location should be  http://localhost:8080/
    # important to close the browser in "teardwown" 
    # so that a failing test won't let an opened browser
    [Teardown]  close browser
