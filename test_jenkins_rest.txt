let's check the REST API works well

note:
for the purpose of the demo, let's assume we have 2 jobs: 1 blue (ok) and the other gray (not yet built)

*** Settings ***
library       requests
library       Collections
Test timeout  5s

*** Test Cases ***
first job should be blue
    color of built should be  job_softshake  blue

first job should be notbuilt
    color of built should be  anotherjob  notbuilt
    
*** Keywords ***
color of built should be
    [arguments]  ${job_name}  ${expected_color}
    ${result} =  get  http://localhost:8080/job/${job_name}/api/json
    ${color} =  get from dictionary  ${result.json()}  color
    should be equal  ${color}  ${expected_color}
